# CO225: Software Construction

## Project 1: Fractals (Individual project)

*Aim*: The aim of this project is to build a somewhat complex piece of software using the techniques
that we have discussed in class. In particular inheritance. Make sure to put sufficient comments to your
code because you will be using this code again later (for a different project).
